## Preparation:

- [ ] Print Paré et al. 2015 for all participants
- [ ] Prepare copies of the review types (for classification)


# Goals

Typical research questions:

- Testing: How effective are chatbot interventiosn for behavioral outcomes?
- Describing. What are the methods and contexts considered by TAM-research?
- Explaining: Why is attentional control inefficient in context X?
- Understanding: How do current research designs restrict our understandign of attention control theory?


## After Paré 2015 reading

- What is your review type?
- Summarize the key characteristics
- For which review type would grey literature be relevant? Which review type is the most/least structured?
- If you were a journal editor/PhD student, which type would you prefer? (-> connect to frequency table: theoretical reviews are often pursued)

## Before classification exercise

- Discuss reading strategy (skim headings/figures etc)
- Ask students to take notes: which parts (figures/statements) led to your decisions?

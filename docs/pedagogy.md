## Educational Philosophy

- Constructivism (Piaget, Vygotsky): Active learning and knowledge construction. Students build their own understanding and knowledge through experiences and reflection. Learning is viewed as an active process, where learners construct meaning based on their prior knowledge and social interactions. The teacher acts as a facilitator, encouraging exploration, inquiry, and collaborative learning. Emphasizes problem-solving, critical thinking, and the application of knowledge in varied contexts.
- Humanism (Rogers, Maslow): Emphasizes self-actualization, emotional well-being, and individual agency. Learning is student-centered, driven by intrinsic motivation, and fosters self-discovery and autonomy. The teacher's role is more of a facilitator or guide, helping learners reach their full potential by creating a supportive environment. Prioritizes developing empathy, self-awareness, and positive self-regard over standardized academic outcomes.
- Essentialism (Bagley, Hirsch): Core knowledge and essential skills: related to literature review methods.

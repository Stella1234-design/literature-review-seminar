# Session 2: Qualities and tools (teaching notes)

## Qualities

Given that transparency is significant, why do some reviews not report their methods explicitly? For example, Alavi and Leidner (2001). Try to take their position and argue why a methods section would not be helpful for their work.

## Tools

Start with a question on students' current thoughts about tool selection in their review protocol.

Highlight that literature review data may be different from typical "reproducible research approaches". Why?
-> Explain the different properties (LRDM), Git

Explicitly show the colrev status

Show the data (that is what CoLRev relies on)

Invite students to contribute to CoLRev (documentation, testing, etc.)


## Outlook

Create a reminder for the presentation session

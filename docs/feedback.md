## Winter semester 2023/24

- As a participant in last semesterâ€™s seminar, I would highly recommend taking part in the Literature Review Seminar with a great instructor who always responds fast and detailed. In this seminar, you learn so many useful things, which you can apply in future research papers. Especially if you are interested in scientific work, you learn everything about the conduction of literature reviews and every single type that exists, including their benefits and rationale. This very complex and important area for the success of all research papers gets simplified, that after completing this seminar, you have a great overview and great knowledge about this methodology. You also see how important and helpful it is to plan every single step in advance. This knowledge helps you a lot for your masters thesis or other academic research papers.
- I had the opportunity to attend the open consultation hour to receive guidance for my current literature review project. Professor Wagner provided valuable advice on the positioning of my literature review, the selection of suitable moderation analyses, and the refinement of my manuscript. His guidance added considerable value to my project. I am very grateful to Professor Wagner for his support and can absolutely recommend the open consultation hour to Ph.D. students.

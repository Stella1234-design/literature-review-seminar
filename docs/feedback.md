## Winter semester 2023/24

- As a participant in last semesterâ€™s seminar, I would highly recommend taking part in the Literature Review Seminar with a great instructor who always responds fast and detailed. In this seminar, you learn so many useful things, which you can apply in future research papers. Especially if you are interested in scientific work, you learn everything about the conduction of literature reviews and every single type that exists, including their benefits and rationale. This very complex and important area for the success of all research papers gets simplified, that after completing this seminar, you have a great overview and great knowledge about this methodology. You also see how important and helpful it is to plan every single step in advance. This knowledge helps you a lot for your masters thesis or other academic research papers.

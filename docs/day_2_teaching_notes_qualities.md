# Session 2: Qualities (teaching notes)

Reminder: submission / presentation dates

## Warm-up exercise

- Ask students to write their topic/RQ/review type on the whiteboard to make the discussion easier

## Qualities

Given that transparency is significant, why do some reviews not report their methods explicitly? For example, Alavi and Leidner (2001). Try to take their position and argue why a methods section would not be helpful for their work.

### Reporting standards

Discuss: which aspects of systematicity/transparency are important for your review, which ones will you skip?

### Theoretical contributions

- Study specific exemplars

**TODO**

- Add Rivard 2024 JSIS.
- Ideally, link to an overview of IS review papers (filtered for impact) 
- Mention scholarship

### Research agenda

Application: read exemplars of research agendas, discuss the key elements, how you research agenda could be developed

The impact of a research agenda: Foresight (research agenda) -> Scientific impact

### Summary

Note: theoretical or empirical contribution: not based on the evidence.

- We can assume that highly transparent papers that lack a contribution will not be cited.

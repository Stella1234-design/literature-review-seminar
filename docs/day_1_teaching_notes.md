# Session 1: Goals and steps (teaching notes)

## Introduction

- I am not an expert in all topics. 
- I have experience with the method, how to ensure a good methodological fit, how to present and develop review papers in a compelling manner.
- Prior experience: TA for 50 PhD students from different management disciplines

- Ask students to write their topics and names on the whiteboard (one after the other, writing similar topics next to each other)
- Ask students about their experience with literature reviews
- Make sure that the topics and student interests receive enough attention

## Literature reviews in IS

- TODO : be prepared to illustrate the concept matrix

## Goals

Typical research questions:

Ask students whether anyone has a research question that fits to one of the four categories

- Testing: How effective are chatbot interventiosn for behavioral outcomes?
- Describing. What are the methods and contexts considered by TAM-research?
- Explaining: Why is attentional control inefficient in context X?
- Understanding: How do current research designs restrict our understandign of attention control theory?


### After ParÃ© 2015 reading

- What is your review type?
- Summarize the key characteristics
- For which review type would grey literature be relevant? Which review type is the most/least structured?
- If you were a journal editor/PhD student, which type would you prefer? (-> connect to frequency table: theoretical reviews are often pursued)


### Before classification exercise

- Discuss reading strategy (skim headings/figures etc)
- Ask students to take notes: which parts (figures/statements) led to your decisions?


### Classification results

Discuss results in groups of goals (testing - explaining, understanding, describing)
Ask students about the differences between types in the groups (what are the key characteristics you noticed?)

- Otte-Trojel2016: Realist review
- King2006b: Meta-analysis
- Melville2004: Theoretical
- Kitsiou2017: Umbrella
- Belanger2011: Critical - highlight that privacy is a multilevel construct but rarely studied as such
- Petter2008: Qualitative systematic
- Powell2004: Scoping
- Shim2002: Narrative
- Seuring2013: Descriptive

Any item that you would use as an inspiration (for your proposal)?

### What can we publish from a review project

Highlight that open science is just getting started in the area of literature reviews

End of first session: take notes on your ideas and how to introduce your topic, take notes on questions you would need to research

## Steps

Ask students to adopt the perspective of a reviewer and scrutinize methodological choices


## Problem formulation

Examples:

- gap spotting: applying and testing transaction cost economics in different empirical contexts (different organizations/geographies)
- problematization: transformational leadership theory is often glorified with a focus on the positive outcomes. A problematization approach may consider unintended outcomes (e.g., promoting groupthink or suppressing dissenting opinions within an organization)

## Search

Exercise (Review the search strategy)

- Hits per sub-query is helpful
- It is implicit/unclear how the search strings are connected (probably OR)
- There is no rationale to include AI Aversion but not ML aversion.
- There is no rationale to require "ML decision" to be an exact match, but Algorithm* Aversion is not required to be an exact match
- For a conference paper, the authors could be required to complete the building-block matrix (or justify the design of the search strategy)

## Screening (reliability)

See notes-screening-reliability.jpg

## Inductive

Worksheet is linked on the slides.

Have students analyze, code in groups

Q: What are the key processes across extracted documents?

Key challenges:
- Terminology
- Scope
- Abstraction
- Differences in focus/perspective

## Data extraction

- For "training": show RCT.jpg.
- Highlight the need to have a clear plan (e.g., which follow-up will be considered?)

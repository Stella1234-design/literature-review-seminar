# Open Consultation Hour

I offer an open consultation hour for Master's and Ph.D. students who work on a literature review project. You can contact me to discuss any of the following topics:

- Positioning of a literature review with regard to the goals, and review types
- Methodological choices across different steps of the process
- Selection of suitable tools and AI-support

# Your instructor: Prof. Dr. Gerit Wagner

- Sustained **fascination** for literature reviews for 10+ years
- 2014-2018: **Disseration** on the scientific impact of literature reviews
- 2020-2023: Postdoctoral fellowship at HEC Montr√©al (Canada):

    - Worked with **Guy Par√©**, Ph.D., a frequent co-author and mentor, who serves as a Senior Editor for Literature Reviews at JAIS
    - Served as a TA for the **literature review seminar** for Ph.D. students at five universities in Montr√©al
 
- I have **published 20 papers related to literature reviews** (out of 30)
- I started developing **CoLRev**, a Python tool for literature reviews

TODO : add the hierarychy of evidence (compare to IS where practitioners may often use practitioner journal/opinion papers)

# Why literature reviews are exciting (I)

Literature reviews are essential to respond to key trends

- The rapid growing volume and variety of research output, e.g., the EQUATOR network lists over 600 guidelines for different research methods
- Expectations to exercise critical judgment of prior research, e.g., retracts, papers in predatory journals, theories or methods that have shortcomings, papers that are written by tools like genAI
- The need to avoid reinventing the wheel, e.g., cases like the grit construct, which is basically identical with conscientiousness
 
In the future, the ability to synthesize, organize, and critically assess prior research will become even more essential.

# Why literature reviews are exciting (II)

Literature reviews can make a variety of original contributions, ranging from 

- conceptual contributions that could never be accomplished in an individual study
- to reviews that aggregate empirical evidence, and address common errors that cannot be eliminated in empirical studies (e.g., measurement error or publication bias)

# Why literature reviews are exciting (III)

- Exemplary contributions can have a profound impact (e.g., Vial 2019 is cited 2,000 times per year)
- There are open challenges, such as 

    - Differences and synergies across disciplines,
    - Design of LR software to manage data, AI, and collaboration,
    - Coping with massive input and addressing urgent demands (e.g., [COVID reviews](https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review))

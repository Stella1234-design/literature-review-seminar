# The Literature Review Seminar

## Qualities

- Distinguish different quality dimensions for literature reviews
- Explain which qualities are essential for the different types of reviews

---

## What makes a review successful?

---

## An empirical analysis

The study of Wagner et al. (2021)

- There is a plethora of commentaries, opinions, suggestions, and ideas on the characteristics of a high quality review 
- We brought together an international and interdisciplinary team to study the question empirically
- The research question: What are the main attributes that affect the scientific impact of IS review papers?
- The research model covers factors at three levels: the paper, the authors, and the journal

## Findings

![center width:1100px](../assets/lr-sciento-findings.png)

---

## Key insights

- Methodological **transparency** is associated with higher scientific impact across all types of reviews
- The development of a **research agenda** is associated with higher scientific impact (except for reviews aimed at theory testing, due to a lack of data)
- The effects vary between **review types**, providing empirical evidence to the notion of methodological and typological pluralism
- Differences in **theoretical contributions** are hard to measure (contributing to *explaining*, in itself, does not lead to a higher impact)

<!-- 
Better present in the protocol part (how to structure a review protocol/paper?)

# Introduction

- Guidelines per section (see topic 11), such as building blocks of an introduction (Lange 2017?)

---

- Application: draft bullet points for the intro etc.
- Application: identify prior reviews and give a short overview

---

# Background

- definition of key concepts
- theoretical lenses
- related reviews

# Findings

- Descriptive profile of the studies
- Writing style
- Theoretical contribution vs. evidence vs. ... (Leidner2020?)
- Theoretical contribution (RTD paper / knowledge contributions that do or do not require a comprehensive review)

## Methodological transparency and systematicity

![center width:600px](../assets/pare2016-twin-concepts.png)

Par√© et al. (2016) sensitize us to the distinction between **systematicity** and **transparency**:
One refers to the *soundness of execution* and the other refers to the *explicitness of reporting*.

<!-- Pare2016/Templier2018 -->
---

## Reporting standards

- In Information Systems, Templier and Par√© (2018) provide an overview of recommended reporting items
- In the health sciences, the [PRISMA checklist](https://www.prisma-statement.org/prisma-2020-checklist) provides established guidelines for transparent reporting of literature reviews

![center width:900px](../assets/prisma-checklist-extract.png)

<!-- - Discuss: which aspects of systematicity/transparency are important for your review, which ones will you skip? -->

---

## Theoretical contributions

- Quality of theoretical contributions is hard to measure
- There are high-level guidelines such as Leidner and Tona's (2021) *thought-gear model for theorizing*

<!--
**TODO : add Rivard 2024 JSIS**

and it may be helpful to study exemplars

 TODO : ideally, link to an overview of IS review papers (filtered for impact) 
scholarship
-->

---

## Research agenda

- Schryen et al. (2020) state that a research agenda "refers to elaborating on how researchers should conduct future research to achieve meaningful progress and possibly suggesting specific research designs, empirical settings, or offering strategic recommendations"
- There are almost no recommendations on how to develop a research agenda
- It may be helpful to study exemplars, which may inspire your research agenda

![center width:800px](../assets/research-agenda-example-1.png)

<!-- - Application: read exemplars of research agendas, discuss the key elements, how you research agenda could be developed -->
<!-- 
---

## The impact of a research agenda

- Foresight (research agenda) -> Scientific impact
---

# Implications

- Contributions / implications for research and practice: Agergalk and Karlsson 2020_Contributions & implications of studies
- Implications for practice: EBP

---

Discussion:

- which qualities would be most important for your review? Identify an example to showcase how those qualities can be achieve.
- do you disagree with a particular quality (for your review)?

 -->
<!-- 
Topic 11
 -->

---

## Summary

Literature reviews can be expected to be more impactful if they

- are positioned with regard to an **appropriate review type**
- are **more transparent** in explicating their methods
- make a compelling and innovative **theoretical or empirical contribution**
- provide more comprehensive **suggestions for future research**

<!-- 
Note: theoretical or empirical contribution: not based on the evidence.
-> we can assume that highly transparent papers that lack a contribution will not be cited.

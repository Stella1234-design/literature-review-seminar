# Prior knowledge of literature reviews, topics, and expectations

- What is your topic and research question for this seminar?
- What are your expectations for the seminar?
- Did you work on a literature review before?

<!--
- What is important for a good literature review?
 Ask about topics, methods papers, challenges -->

# Your instructor: Prof. Dr. Gerit Wagner

- Sustained **fascination** for literature reviews for 10+ years
- 2014-2018: **Disseration** on the scientific impact of literature reviews
- 2020-2023: Postdoctoral fellowship at HEC Montr√©al (Canada):

    - worked with **Guy Par√©**, Ph.D., a frequent co-author and mentor, who serves as a Senior Editor for Literature Reviews at JAIS
    - served as a TA for the **literature review seminar** for Ph.D. students at five universities in Montr√©al
 
- I have **published 20 papers related to literature reviews** (out of 30)
- I started developing **CoLRev**, a Python tool for literature reviews

# Why literature reviews are exciting (I)

Literature reviews are essential to respond to key trends

- The rapid growing volume and variety of research output, e.g., the EQUATOR network lists over 600 guidelines for different research methods
- Expectations to exercise critical judgment of prior research, e.g., retracts, papers in predatory journals, theories or methods that have shortcomings, papers that are written by tools like genAI
- The need to avoid reinventing the wheel, e.g., cases like the grit construct, which is basically identical with consciensciousness
 
In the future, the ability to synthesize, organize, and critically assess prior research will become even more essential.

<!--
This slide is more on the reaction, the next more on active contributions

sheer volume of research:
- our capacity to synthesize it will become much more important
- our capacity to organize (make sense of prior research)
- our capacity to scrutinize (and sort out the bad apples)

reinventing the wheel (grit - meta-analysis)

https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-29674-001

Note: in the search: connect to jangle-fallacies (generally the lack of controlled terminology)

understanding cumulative and non-cumulative episodes (not as clear as with Kuhnian scientific revolutions, but senior scholars know: if you use a particular theory that it is old/has been criticized...)

# Why literature reviews are exciting (II)

Literature reviews can make a variety of original contributions, ranging from 

- conceptual contributions that could never be accomplished in an individual study
- to reviews that aggregate empirical evidence, and address common errors that cannot be eliminated in empirical studies (e.g., measurement error or publication bias)

# Example: Media Synchronicity Theory (Dennis et al. 2006)

![center width:650px](../assets/DennisEtAl2006.png)

<!--
Rationale: impossible for an individual empirical study because there would be too many variables that must vary (just imagine an experiment!)
Especially at group/organizational levels where research designs are much more limited (no experiments)
Especially macro-level theories. Similarly: RBV -->

# Example: Review of the IS Success model (Petter et al. 2008)

# Why literature reviews are exciting (III)

- Exemplary contributions can have a profound impact (e.g., Vial 2019 is cited 2,000 times per year)
- There are open challenges, such as 

    - Differences and synergies across disciplines,
    - Design of LR software to manage data, AI, and collaboration,
    - Coping with massive input and addressing urgent demands (e.g., [COVID reviews](https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review))

- the **qualities** of a good review paper
- the **tools** available

# Outcome

- A **review protocol** applying this understanding and a short **presentation**
- [Criteria and resources](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/literature-review-seminar/docs/protocol.html) are available online
- Dates for submission and presentation: see [outline](../index.html#seminar-paper)

<!-- January 26, presentation: February 1 -->

## Your expectations for the lecture "Introduction to Digital Work"

Studieng√§nge?
Semester?
Wer plant den Master zu machen?
Jemand, der nicht in Bamberg bleiben m√∂chte?
Wer schon im Auslandssemester/Wo?
Wer schon ein Praktikum?
Wer hat ein klares Berufsziel?

Was interessiert Sie an Digital Work, was w√ºrden Sie gerne lernen?

# Learning objectives

- Understand the historical, organizational, and societal drivers of change in digital work.
- Familiarize with a repertoire of techniques, methods, and policies for effective digital work at the levels of individuals, teams, and crowds.
- Apply, adapt, and critically discuss these methods in different practical contexts.
- Appreciate different forms of scientific knowledge, theories, and methods prevalent in research on digital work.


critically discuss: understand where they come from/how they were developed (based on what evidence/theories)
Critically discuss ethical challenges associated with the future of work.

Modulkatalog:
Nach Abschluss des Kurses haben die Studierenden ein Verst√§ndnis √ºber die Ver√§nderungen, Gestaltungsbereiche und Auswirkungen digitaler Arbeit. Insbesondere k√∂nnen sie ein Repertoire ausgew√§hlter Methoden, Designprinzipien und organisationelle Policies erkl√§ren und situativ anwenden. Zudem k√∂nnen sie die Evaluation einzelner Ma√ünahmen diskutieren und sie mit diesem Hintergrundwissen  effektiv und verantwortungsvoll in der Praxis einsetzen.

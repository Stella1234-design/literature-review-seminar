# The Literature Review Seminar

Seminar, Master

Prof. Dr. Gerit Wagner
Fakultät Wirtschaftsinformatik und Angewandte Informatik
Universität Bamberg

---

## Prior knowledge of literature reviews, topics, and expectations

- Did you work on a literature review before?
- What is your topic and research question for this seminar?
- What are your expectations for the seminar?

<!--
- What is important for a good literature review?
 Ask about topics, methods papers, challenges -->

## Your instructor: Prof. Dr. Gerit Wagner

- Developed my **fascination** for literature reviews since 2014
- **Disseration** on the scientific impact of literature reviews
- Postdoctoral fellowship at HEC Montréal (Canada):

    - worked with **Guy Paré**, Ph.D., a frequent co-author and mentor, who serves as a Senior Editor for Literature Reviews at JAIS
    - teaching assistant for the **literature review seminar** for Ph.D. students at five universities in Montréal
 
- I have **published 20 papers related to literature reviews** (out of 30)
- Started developing **CoLRev**, a Python tool for literature reviews

## Why literature reviews are exciting (I)

- Variety of contributions, ranging from 

    - conceptual contributions that could never be accomplished in an individual study
    - to reviews that aggregate empirical evidence, and address common errors that cannot be eliminated in empirical studies (e.g., measurement error or publication bias)

## Example: Media Synchronicity Theory (Dennis et al. 2006)

![center width:650px](../assets/DennisEtAl2006.png)

<!--
Rationale: impossible for an individual empirical study because there would be too many variables that must vary (just imagine an experiment!)
Especially at group/organizational levels where research designs are much more limited (no experiments)
Especially macro-level theories. Similarly: RBV -->

## Example: Review of the IS Success model (Petter et al. 2008)

## Why literature reviews are exciting (II)

- Exemplary contributions can have a profound impact (e.g., Vial 2019 is cited 1000 times per year)
- There are open challenges, such as 

    - differences and synergies across disciplines,
    - design of LR software to manage data, AI, and collaboration,
    - coping with massive input and addressing urgent demands (e.g., [COVID reviews](https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review))

## Learning objectives

Acquire a broad understanding of

- the goals and types of literature reviews
- the steps of the process
- the qualities of a good review paper
- the available research software

## Outcome

- A **review protocol** applying this understanding
- [Criteria and resources](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/literature-review-seminar/docs/protocol.html) are available online
- Submission: **TBA** 

<!-- January 26, presentation: February 1 -->

## Your expectations for the lecture "Introduction to Digital Work"

Studiengänge?
Semester?
Wer plant den Master zu machen?
Jemand, der nicht in Bamberg bleiben möchte?
Wer schon im Auslandssemester/Wo?
Wer schon ein Praktikum?
Wer hat ein klares Berufsziel?

Was interessiert Sie an Digital Work, was würden Sie gerne lernen?

# Learning objectives

- Understand the historical, organizational, and societal drivers of change in digital work.
- Familiarize with a repertoire of techniques, methods, and policies for effective digital work at the levels of individuals, teams, and crowds.
- Apply, adapt, and critically discuss these methods in different practical contexts.
- Appreciate different forms of scientific knowledge, theories, and methods prevalent in research on digital work.


critically discuss: understand where they come from/how they were developed (based on what evidence/theories)
Critically discuss ethical challenges associated with the future of work.

Modulkatalog:
Nach Abschluss des Kurses haben die Studierenden ein Verständnis über die Veränderungen, Gestaltungsbereiche und Auswirkungen digitaler Arbeit. Insbesondere können sie ein Repertoire ausgewählter Methoden, Designprinzipien und organisationelle Policies erklären und situativ anwenden. Zudem können sie die Evaluation einzelner Maßnahmen diskutieren und sie mit diesem Hintergrundwissen  effektiv und verantwortungsvoll in der Praxis einsetzen.
